# DS-pa2

Part 1 :
Write a C++ function to build a Huffman tree by using the following
alphabets and their weight:
A = 11 B = 5 C = 2 D = 3 E = 12 F = 3 G = 5
H = 6 I = 8 J = 1 K = 2 L = 4 M = 8 N = 7
O = 2 P = 2 Q = 1 R = 9 S = 6 T = 2 U = 4
V = 1 W = 10 X = 10 Y = 1 Z = 1
Output the Huffman code represented by each letter
—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2 :
Write a C++ program to read characters from the file (e.g., ./test/1.txt )
Create your own Huffman tree and convert each letter to Huffman code.

Part 3 :
Continue with Part 2 , write a C++ program to read the Huffman code
(e.g., 0101000…. ) from the same file .
And according to your Huffman Tree which you created in Part 2 ,
decode them(Huffman code) to the characters
